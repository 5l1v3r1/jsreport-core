For more informations about the platform please visit http://jsreport.net\n\n## Production installation\nsee [http://jsreport.net/downloads](http://jsreport.net/downloads)\n\n## Development\nTo be able to install and start jsreport on your development machine you need to do following.\n\n1. install nodejs\n2. clone this repository\n3. npm install\n4. npm start\n\nYou may find installation troubleshooting guide specific for your platform [here](https://github.com/jsreport/docs/tree/master/installation).\n\nSee [Gruntfile.js](https://github.com/jsreport/jsreport/blob/master/Gruntfile.js) for build automation options.\n\n###Environemnts\njsreport adapts to `production` and `development` nodejs environments. Difference is that in `production` environment you get javascript files combined and minified for fast web application startup opposite to `development` environment where you get all js files individually what makes debugging easier. Second difference is that in `production` environment jsreport use `prod.config.json` as configuration file opposite to `dev.config.json` in `development.\n\nTo change environment use cmd `set NODE_ENV=development` or use options your IDE provides. If you don't specify node environment jsreport assumes production as default.\n\n###Configurations\njsreport loads `dev.config.json` or `prod.config.json` configuration file on start up based on nodejs environment. If configuration file is not found, jsreport creates default configuration file from `example.config.json`.\n\nSee [config](https://github.com/jsreport/jsreport/blob/master/config.md) documentation for details.\n\n###Tests\n\n **grunt test** - start tests with file system based db (neDb), no mongo needed\n\n **grunt test-mongo** - start tests with mongo db, mongodb must be running on localhost\n\n **grunt test-all** - start tests with nedb and then once again with mongo (used with travis CI)\n\n **grunt test-integration** - start all tests with nedb including integration tests,  needs java, fop and phantomjs running\n\n## Extensions and Contributions\nThe easisest way how to contribute to jsreport open source community is to implement jsreport extension.\nPlease see [contrib repository](https://github.com/jsreport/jsreport-contrib) for examples.\n\nPull requests to this core repository are also welcome.\n\n##Roadmap\n\n###current\njsreport is currently in beta state. We are focusing mostly on the following areas:\n\n1. Fix incoming bugs from users\n2. Improve codebase to make easier open source contributions\n3. java sdk\n4. node.js sdk\n5. Collect new features for jsreport vNext\n\n###vNext\n\nFollowing features are currently on the list, but it's subject to be changed.\n\n####Scheduled reports generation\n\n####End user custom reporting extension \nDevelopers can export from jsreport lightweight embeddable html page allowing end user to simply modify report colors or reorganize report by drag and drop.\n\n####Chrome javascript helpers debugging\n\n####Other features???\n\n## License \n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Jan Blaha &lt;jan.blaha at hotmail.com&gt;\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as\npublished by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the\nLicense.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
